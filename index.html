                <p>i enjoy traveling as much as i can. for the last few years i have been traveling and have enjoyed exploring. i have
                    gone to many states and abroad. to name a few, i have gone to an all-inclusive resort in jamaica,
                    which is one of the best memories. i have also gone to puerto rico for a reggae fastival, maui and
                    honolulu, as well as portugal. i visited paris in 2021 with my family, and enjoyed as many fresh
                    croissants as possible. view my gallery for pictures of my travels.</p>
